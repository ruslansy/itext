# itext is a Java PDF generation library

## Background ##

Beginning with version 5.0 the developers have moved to the AGPL to improve their ability to sell commercial licenses. I fully respect the developers' wishes and rights. This is a fork of the final MPL/LGPL version of iText released under the LGPL 3 license.
