# iText is a Java PDF library originally dual licensed under MPL/LGPL #

## Background ##

Beginning with version 5.0 the developers have moved to the AGPL to improve their ability to sell commercial licenses. I fully respect the developers' wishes and rights. To assist those desiring to stick with the old license I'm making the final MPL/LGPL version more easily available.
